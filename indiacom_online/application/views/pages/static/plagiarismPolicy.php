                    Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else's prior ideas, processes, results or words
                    without
                    explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source. Self-plagiarism occurs when an author
                    utilizes
                    large part of his/her own previously published work without using appropriate references. This can
                    range
                    from getting the same manuscript published in multiple journals to modifying a previously published
                    manuscript with some new data.
