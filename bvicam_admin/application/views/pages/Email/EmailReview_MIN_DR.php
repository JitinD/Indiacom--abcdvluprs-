The reviews of your Paper are now complete and it is my pleasure to inform you that the consensual decision of the Technical Programme Committee is to accept the above mentioned paper for presentation and publication in INDIACom - 2014, subject to minor revisions, in response to the comments of the Board of Referees (BoR), which are given at the end of this notification, and submit the thoroughly revised paper for re-consideration at the earliest but not later than 10 days. Upon receipt of the suitably revised paper, it will again be reviewed by the same set of reviewers. It is, therefore, requested to create a master list of revisions/rebuttals, responding to each point raised by the reviewers, in the format attached herewith.  If you feel that the reviewers' comment does not warrant a revision, please prepare a reasoned rebuttal to their comment, in the same format.<br/><br/>
