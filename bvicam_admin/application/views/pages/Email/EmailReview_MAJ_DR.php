The reviews of your Paper are now complete and the consensual decision of the Programme Committee is that the paper is not suitable for its acceptance in INDIACom - 2014 in its current form. Substantial revisions are required and further reviews are necessary to assess its suitability for presentation and publication in INDIACom - 2014. You are, therefore, informed to substantially revise your paper, in response to the comments of the Board of Referees (BoR), which are given at the end of this notification, and submit the thoroughly revised paper for re-consideration at the earliest but not later than 15 days. Upon receipt of the suitably revised paper, it will again be reviewed by the same set of reviewers. It is, therefore, requested to create a master list of revisions/rebuttals, responding to each point raised by the reviewers, in the format attached herewith.
